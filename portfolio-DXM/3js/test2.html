        FitLogger is a React.js project currently being made in collaboration with Luke Schmit, primary for personal usage.

      <span>
        The goal of the App is to provide its users with a highly modular interface allowing them to freely plan and follow weekly diet, exercise and other athletic-related goals. Thanks to React's component and hooks system, FitLogger will be able to provide a very comprehensive tracker module that will let users switch from imperial to metric, change daily work-out sessions on the fly, and share their plans with anyone, be it friends, students or coach.

      <span>
        Based on the world of the movie STALKER by Andrei Tarkovsky and the subsequent, Psychophobia is a fan-project entirely made on JavaScript. I've started this game from scratch in April 2024, back when I just started learning coding. The purpose being to practice my first language (JS/HTML/CSS) and get familiar with new concepts by integrating them into this project as I learn them.

        Currently all the foundations and core system of a classic RPG game have been implemented: Inventory, level and equipment system, Randomized loot, Asynchronous combat, Multiple factions with reputation as well as a roguelite approach for replayability and gameplay diversity.
